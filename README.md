# Movie-Rental

Simple C# app based on an example from Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code". This is the somewhat finished, albeit a work in progress. I am saving it for my own records of my class work from my level 7 software development class at NMIT (SDV701)

The example provided in the book was written in java so there have been some liberties taken in transcoding between java and C#.

UML was created using Visual Paradigm.
